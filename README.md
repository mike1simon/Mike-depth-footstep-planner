# Footstep Planning for Humanoid Robots Using Perception-based Feasible Footsteps in Cluttered Environments
## By Mike Simon

This repository contains the source code and documentation for my Master's thesis submitted in fulfillment of the requirements for the Masterâ€™s Degree in Control and Robotics, Specialty Robotics. The research focuses on developing an enhanced footstep planning algorithm for humanoid robots navigating cluttered environments, leveraging neural networks to pre-analyze the terrain and improve the efficiency of the ARA* algorithm's search expansion.
## Abstract

This work introduces an improvement to the footstep planning algorithm by utilizing neural networks for a preliminary analysis of the environment, thereby accelerating the search expansion process of the ARA* algorithm. The methodology encompasses several stages, starting from analyzing the terrain map with deep learning and neural networks based on a modified U-Net architecture. This is followed by a 2D expansion algorithm that propagates through the terrain map, serving as a heuristic cost function for the footstep planning process. A significant contribution of this research is the adaptation of an existing software package to map the planned footsteps from a 2D environment to a 3D one using the Robot Operating System (ROS). The findings of this study offer a foundational step towards further advancements in path planning algorithms and environmental modeling for humanoid robots.

### Master Thesis:
you can download the Thesis (in Arabic) from the Higher Institute for Applied Sciences and Technology [website](https://hiast.edu.sy/en/Master-PhD-Theses) or [here PDF](https://hiast.edu.sy/sites/default/files/MasterPHD/62c2e34f9ad01.pdf)

### 
### Dependencies

This project relies on various ROS packages and external libraries to function properly. Below is a list of dependencies required to build and run the `depth_footstep_planner` package:

#### ROS Packages:

- `depthmap_humanoid_msgs`: Custom message definitions for depth maps in humanoid robotics (assumed to be a custom package not found in standard ROS distributions).
- `humanoid_nav_msgs`: Custom message definitions used in humanoid navigation (assumed to be a custom package not found in standard ROS distributions).
- `nav_msgs`: Contains common messages that are used to interact with the navigation stack.
- `visualization_msgs`: Contains messages for visualizing data such as markers in tools like RViz.

#### External Libraries and Additional Dependencies:

- **PyTorch**: 
For PyTorch, please follow the [official PyTorch installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install it according to your system configuration and CUDA compatibility (required for UNET model).

- **Boost System**:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libboost-system-dev
    ```

- **OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)**:
OpenCV is typically included in ROS desktop-full installations. If not, it can be installed using:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
    ```

- **SBPL**:

    The SBPL library might need to be installed from source if not available in your ROS distribution:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sbpl/sbpl.git
    cd sbpl
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install
    ```


### Setup and Installation

Instructions for setting up the environment and installing dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mike1simon/Mike-depth-footstep-planner.git

# Navigate to the repository
